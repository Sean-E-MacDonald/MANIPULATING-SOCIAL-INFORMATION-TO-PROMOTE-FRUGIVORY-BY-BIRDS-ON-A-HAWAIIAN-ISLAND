MacDonald, S.E., Ward, M.P., and J.H. Sperry. 2019. Manipulating social information to promote frugivory by birds on a Hawaiian Island. Ecological Applications...

These data were collected for a project that investigated if social information, in the form of broadcasted bird vocalizations, of introduced birds could increase visitations and more importantly frugivory on focal fruiting plants. The project was conudcted on the Island of Oahu, Hawaii from December 2015 to July 2018. We conducted 80 playback experiments at native and introduced fruiting plants, and compared responses to silent control periods. These data were collected along with other data via avian surveys conducted to determine frugivore abundances around restoration sites. 

There are 8 tabs for the data file: 
  1. Key for sites, Bird & plant species, weather metrics, etc.
  2. Metadata for the playback experiment
  3. Raw playback experiment data (n=80)
  4. Raw avian survey data (n=238)
  5. Estimates of Pearson's chi-squared test used in analyses section of research article
  6. The total number of minutes a frugivore species spent within 10 meters of focal plant during all (n=80) playback experiments
  7. The total number of detections during all (n=80) playback experiments across all bird species
  8. The total number of focal frugivore species detected per survey during all (n=238) avian surveys
